# Speech-emotion-recognition-system

Welcome to the Speech Emotion Recognition Project! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the implementation of a machine learning model to recognize emotions from speech data.

## Overview
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a crucial area in artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. This project aims to classify speech recordings into different emotional categories using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The model processes audio features and predicts the corresponding emotion.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

### Dataset
The project utilizes a speech emotion dataset, which consists of audio recordings labeled with emotions such as:
- Angry
- Happy
- Sad
- Neutral
- Fearful
- Disgusted
- Surprised

Each audio sample is processed to extract meaningful features that are used for classification.

### Implementation
The `Speech_Emotion_Recognization.ipynb` notebook walks through the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Loading the dataset, handling missing values, and extracting relevant audio features such as MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients).
2. **Feature Extraction:** Converting raw audio data into numerical representations suitable for model training.
3. **Model Training:** Implementing and training a classification model (e.g., CNN, RNN, or SVM) on the extracted features.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Testing the model's performance and evaluating accuracy using appropriate metrics.
5. **Visualization:** Plotting graphs and confusion matrices to analyze model performance.

To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Speech-Emotion-Recognition.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Speech-Emotion-Recognition
   ```

3. **Install the necessary dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook and open `Speech_Emotion_Recognization.ipynb`:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Results
The trained model successfully classifies speech samples into different emotions with high accuracy. The visualization section provides detailed plots that help in understanding the model's predictions and performance.
